# How many do we keep around?  We need to do log aggregation (not
# written yet), so we keep them around "forever" right now.

# Give myself 180 days to write the code.  If log aggregation hasn't
# happened by then, I'm a loser and deserve suffering.
# Once that happens, this number should decrease to something more rational.

# (Looks like *that* didn't happen...)

# Don't compress the file on rotation; do it the second time.  We like

# In fact, we *have* to keep the logs uncompressed for a day, because
# we don't restart the Web server ourselves.
